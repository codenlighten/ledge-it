This is a minimal app to show the ability of bitcoin-computer to place immutable data on the BSV Bitcoin Blockchain. Created by Clemens Ley, the Bitcoin-Computer uses a javascript library specifically for interacting with the bitcoin blockchain. This app is a simple expression of how to place a statement on the public ledger, and retrieve it afterwards.

The eventual goal is to make this into an app for various purposes such as:

1 - a twitter replica, where you can have your friend's public addresses stored as well, to see a feed of their comments. 
2 - a simple day planner, or note taker
3 - a way to memorialize a statement permanently

That being said, the blockchain is immutable and permanent. Use these apps with responsibility. You can not erase what is placed on the blockchain, so only post those things you don't mind being there years from now. Cheers, -Greg (codenlighten)
